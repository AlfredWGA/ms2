This altered bone turnover is not due to the action of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , but appears to be related to the suppression of osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) . As <int> vitamin K2 ( menatetrenone ) </int> has been used for the treatment of osteoporosis , the present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of vitamin K2 on <int> GC-induced </int> bone loss . <pop> Twenty patients with chronic glomerulonephritis treated with <int> GC </int> for the first time were chosen </pop> for this study . <pop> Ten patients received <int> GC alone </int> </pop> ( group A ) and the other 10 patients each received <int> 15 mg of vitamin K2 per </int> day in addition <int> to GC </int> ( group B ) . Markers of <out> bone metabolism </out> , including <out> serum OPG , osteocalcin ( OC ) , bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity ( BAP ) , PTH , tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) , and bone mineral density ( BMD ) </out> , were measured before and during the treatment . <out> OPG </out> was significantly decreased in group A ( P < 0.001 ) , while no significant change was seen in group B. <out> TRAP </out> was markedly increased in both groups , more particularly in group A ( P < 0.01 ) . <out> PTH </out> was decreased in group A , but was increased in group B. <out> OC </out> was decreased at month 1 but subsequently increased until month 12 in both groups . <out> BAP </out> had decreased at month 3 in group A ( P < 0.05 ) , but not in group B. <out> BMD of the lumbar spine </out> was significantly reduced after 6 months ( P < 0.01 ) , and 12 months ( P < 0.001 ) of treatment in group A , whereas there was no remarkable change in group B.

In a phase 2 clinical trial , <int> strontium ranelate </int> , an orally active drug that dissociates bone remodeling by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption , has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and to increase <out> bone mineral density . </out> METHODS To evaluate the efficacy of <int> strontium ranelate </int> in preventing vertebral fractures in a phase 3 trial , we r and omly assigned <pop> 1649 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis ( low bone mineral density ) and at least one vertebral fracture to receive 2 g of <int> oral strontium ranelate </int> per day or <int> placebo </int> for three years . </pop> We gave <int> calcium </int> and <int> vitamin D </int> supplements to both groups before and during the study . Vertebral radiographs were obtained annually , and measurements of <out> bone mineral density </out> were performed every six months . RESULTS <out> New vertebral fractures </out> occurred in fewer patients in the <int> strontium ranelate </int> group than in the <int> placebo </int> group , with a risk <out> reduction </out> of 49 percent in the first year of treatment and 41 percent during the three-year study period ( relative risk , 0.59 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.48 to 0.73 ) . <int> Strontium ranelate </int> increased <out> bone mineral density </out> at month 36 by 14.4 percent at the lumbar spine and 8.3 percent at the femoral neck ( P<0.001 for both comparisons ) . There were no significant differences between the groups in the <out> incidence of serious adverse events . </out> CONCLUSIONS Treatment of <pop> postmenopausal osteoporosis </pop> with <int> strontium ranelate </int> leads to early and sustained reductions in the risk of vertebral fractures",

To underst and the mechanism of the increase in the <out> ucOC </out> in the elderly and to assess its potential consequences on bone fragility , we have measured <int> <out> ucOC </int> </out> in the sera of <pop> 195 elderly institutionalized women 70 - 101 yr of age . </pop> In 45 women ( 23 % ) <out> serum ucOC </out> was above the upper limit of the normal range for <pop> young women . </pop> The <out> level of ucOC </out> was negatively correlated with <out> 25OHD </out> ( r = -0.32 , P < 0.001 ) even after excluding the effect of age , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , and creatinine by partial correlation ( r = -0.24 , P < 0.002 ) . During an 18-mo follow-up , 15 women sustained a <out> hip fracture </out> and their baseline <out> ucOC level </out> was higher ( P < 0.01 ) in women who subsequently sustained hip fracture than in the nonfracture group contrasting with no significant differences for <out> serum calcium , phosphate , alkaline phosphatase , creatinine , PTH , 250HD , </out> and <out> total and carboxylated OC . </out> The <out> risk of hip fracture </out> was increased in women with <out> elevated ucOC </out> ( relative ratio 5.9 , 99.9 % Cl 1.5 - 22.7 , P < 0.001 ) . During 1 yr of <int> calcium/vitamin D2 </int> treatment , <out> ucOC </out> decreased ( P < 0.05 ) , especially in those with the initially increased values ( from 2.22 + /- 0.35 to 1.41 + /- 0.29 ng/ml , P < 0.005 ) contrasting with an increase in the placebo group ( P < 0.05 ) . In conclusion , the increase in <out> ucOC </out> in the elderly reflects not only some degree of vitamin K deficiency but also their poor vitamin D status , suggesting that vitamin D may be important , either directly or indirectly through its effect on bone turnover , for achieving a normal gamma-carboxylation of OC . The <out> ucOC </out> , but not conventional calcium metabolism parameters , predicts the subsequent risk of <out> hip fracture </out> , suggesting that <out> serum ucOC </out> reflects some changes in bone matrix associated with increased fragility",

High serum concentrations of undercarboxylated osteocalcin and low serum concentrations of <int> vitamin K </int> are associated with lower bone mineral density and increased risk of hip fracture . However , data are limited on the effects of dietary <int> vitamin K. </int> OBJECTIVE We investigated the hypothesis that high intakes of <int> vitamin K </int> are associated with a lower <out> <pop> risk of hip fracture </out> in women . </pop> DESIGN We conducted a prospect i ve analysis within the Nurses ' Health Study cohort . <out> Diet </out> was assessed in <pop> 72327 women aged 38 - 63 y with a food-frequency question naire in 1984 ( baseline ) </pop> . During the subsequent 10 y of follow-up , <pop> 270 hip fractures </pop> result ing from low or moderate trauma were reported . RESULTS Women in quintiles 2 - 5 of <int> vitamin K </int> intake had a significantly lower <out> age-adjusted relative risk </out> ( RR : 0.70 ; 95 % CI : 0.53 , 0.93 ) of <out> hip </out> fracture than women in the lowest quintile ( < 109 microg/d ) . Risk did not decrease between quintiles 2 and 5 and risk estimates were not altered when other risk factors for osteoporosis , including calcium and vitamin D intakes , were added to the models . <out> Risk of hip fracture </out> was also inversely associated with <int> lettuce </int> consumption ( RR : 0.55 ; 95 % CI : 0.40 , 0.78 ) for one or more servings per day compared with one or fewer servings per week ) , the food that contributed the most to dietary <int> vitamin K </int> intakes . CONCLUSIONS Low intakes of <int> vitamin K </int> may increase the <out> <pop> risk of hip fracture </out> in women . </pop> The data support the suggestion for a re assessment of the <int> vitamin K </int> requirements that are based on bone health and blood coagulation",

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine whether <int> phylloquinone ( vitamin K(1 ) ) intake </int> and biochemical indicators of <int> vitamin K </int> status are related to <out> bone mineral content ( BMC ) </out> and markers of bone formation and bone resorption in <pop> girls . </pop> DESIGN <int> Vitamin K status </int> [ plasma phylloquinone concentration and percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin ( % ucOC ) ] was measured at baseline in a study of <pop> 245 healthy girls aged 3 - 16 y. </pop> Cross-linked N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen ( NTx ) breakdown , osteocalcin , and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were measured to reflect bone resorption and formation . BMC of <out> the total body </out> , <out> lumbar spine </out> , and hip and dietary <int> phylloquinone </int> intake were measured annually for 4 y. RESULTS <int> Phylloquinone </int> intake ( median : 45 microg/d ) was not consistently associated with <out> bone turnover markers or BMC . </out> Better vitamin K status ( high plasma phylloquinone and low % ucOC ) was associated with <out> lower bone resorption and formation . </out> Plasma phylloquinone was inversely associated with <out> NTx and osteocalcin concentrations </out> ( P < 0.05 ) , and % <out> ucOC </out> was positively associated with <out> NTx and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations </out> ( P < 0.05 ) . Indicators of vitamin K status were not consistently associated with current <out> BMC or gain in BMC </out> over the 4-y study period . CONCLUSIONS Better vitamin K status was associated with decreased bone turnover in <pop> healthy girls consuming a typical US diet . </pop> R and omized <int> phylloquinone </int> supplementation trials are needed to further underst and the potential benefits of <int> phylloquinone </int> on bone acquisition in growing children",

Study Design : Prospect i ve cohort study . Methods : We classified <pop> 115 female endurance athletes </pop> into <pop> amenorrheic , <int> eumenorrheic </int> , or <int> estrogen-supplemented </int> groups </pop> and r and omized them to receive either <int> placebo or vitamin K1 . </int> The <out> bone mineral densities of the </out> subjects <out> ' femoral neck and lumbar spine </out> were measured at baseline and after 2 years . Results : <out> Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine </out> remained constant , but <out> bone density in the femoral neck </out> had decreased significantly after 2 years in all three subgroups . The decrease was higher in amenorrheic ( \u20146.5 % \u00b1 4.0 % ) than in eumenorrheic ( \u20143.2 % \u00b1 4.1 % ) and estrogen-supplemented athletes ( \u20143.9 % \u00b1 3.1 % ) . Supplementation with <int> vitamin K </int> did not affect <out> the rate of bone loss . </out> Conclusions : <out> The rate of bone loss </out> in all three subgroups of <pop> female athletes </pop> was unexpectedly high ; neither estrogen nor vitamin K supplementation prevented bone loss . Clinical Relevance : High-intensity training maintained over several years must be regarded in women as a risk factor for osteoporosis , and protocol s for optimal treatment should be developed",

The Fracture Intervention Trial aim ed to investigate the effect of <int> alendronate </int> on the risk of morphometric as well as clinical ly evident fractures in <pop> postmenopausal women with low bone mass . </pop> METHODS <pop> Women aged 55 - 81 with low femoral-neck BMD </pop> were enrolled in two study groups based on presence or absence of an existing vertebral fracture . Results for <pop> women with at least one vertebral fracture at baseline </pop> are reported here . <pop> 2027 women were r and omly </pop> assigned <int> placebo </int> ( 1005 ) or <int> alendronate </int> ( 1022 ) and followed up for 36 months . The dose of <int> alendronate </int> ( initially 5 mg daily ) was increased ( to 10 mg daily ) at 24 months , with maintenance of the double blind . Lateral spine radiography was done at baseline and at 24 and 36 months . <out> New vertebral fractures </out> , the primary endpoint , were defined by morphometry as a decrease of 20 % ( and at least 4 mm ) in at least one vertebral height between the baseline and latest follow-up radiograph . <out> Non-spine clinical fractures </out> were confirmed by radiographic reports . New <out> symptomatic vertebral fractures </out> were based on self-report and confirmed by radiography . FINDINGS Follow-up radiographs were obtained for <pop> 1946 women </pop> ( 98 % of surviving participants ) . 78 ( 8.0 % ) of women in the <int> alendronate </int> group had one or more new <out> morphometric vertebral fractures </out> compared with 145 ( 15.0 % ) in the <int> placebo </int> group ( relative risk 0.53 [ 95 % Cl 0.41 - 0.68 ] ) . For clinical ly apparent <out> vertebral fractures </out> , the corresponding numbers were 23 ( 2.3 % ) <int> alendronate </int> and 50 ( 5.0 % ) <int> placebo </int> ( relative hazard 0.45 [ 0.27 - 0.72 ] ) . The <out> risk of any clinical fracture </out> , the main secondary endpoint , was lower in the <int> alendronate </int> than in the <int> placebo </int> group ( 139 [ 13.6 % ] vs 183 [ 18.2 % ] ; relative hazard 0.72 [ 0.58 - 0.90 ] ) . The <out> relative hazards for hip fracture and wrist fracture </out> for <int> alendronate </int> versus <int> placebo </int> were 0.49 ( 0.23 - 0.99 ) and 0.52 ( 0.31 - 0.87 ) . There was no significant difference between the groups in <out> numbers of adverse experiences , including upper-gastrointestinal disorders . </out> INTERPRETATION We conclude that <pop> among women with low bone mass and existing vertebral <out> </pop> fractures </out> , <int> alendronate </int> is well tolerated and substantially reduces the <out> frequency of morphometric and clinical vertebral fractures </out> , as well as other clinical fractures",

The design of our study was a r and omized , double-blind , <int> placebo-controlled </int> intervention study ; <pop> 181 healthy postmenopausal women between 50 and 60 years old were recruited , 155 of whom completed the study . </pop> During the 3-year treatment period , participants received a <int> daily supplement containing either placebo , or calcium , magnesium , zinc , and vitamin D ( MD group ) , or the same formulation with additional vitamin K1 ( MDK group ) </int> . The main outcome was <out> the change in BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine after 3 years , </out> as measured by DXA .

Ninety-two osteoporotic women who were more than 5 years after menopause , aged 55\u201381 years </pop> , were r and omly divided into four administration groups : <int> vitamin D3 ( 1\u03b1 hydroxyvitamin D3 , </int> 0.75 <int> \u03bcg/day ) </int> ( D group ; n = 29 ) , <int> vitamin K2 ( menatetrenone , 45 </int> mg/day <int> ) </int> ( K group ; n = 22 ) , <int> vitamin D3 plus vitamin K2 </int> ( DK group , n = 21 ) , and <int> calcium ( calcium lactate , 2 g/day ) </int> ( C group ; n = <out> 20 ) . BMD of the lumbar spine ( L2\u2013L4 ) </out> was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at 0 , 1 , and 2 years after the treatment started . There were no significant differences in <out> age , body mass index , years since menopause , and initial BMD </out> among the four groups . One-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with repeated measurements showed a significant decrease <out> in BMD </out> in the C group ( P < 0.001 ) . Two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements showed a significant <out> increase in BMD </out> in the D and K groups compared with that in the C group ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.001 , respectively ) , and a significant increase <out> in </out> BMD in the DK group compared with that in the C , D , and K groups ( P < 0.0001 , P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 , respectively ) . These findings indicate that combined administration <int> of vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 </int> , compared with calcium administration , appears to be useful in <out> increasing the BMD of the lumbar spine </out> in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis",

METHODS We recruited <pop> 36,282 postmenopausal women , 50 to 79 years of age , who were already enrolled in a Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) clinical trial . </pop> We r and omly assigned participants to receive <int> 1000 mg of elemental [ corrected ] calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo . </int> <out> Fractures </out> were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years . <out> Bone density </out> was measured at three WHI centers . RESULTS <out> Hip bone density </out> was 1.06 percent higher in the <int> calcium plus vitamin D </int> group than in the <int> placebo </int> group ( P<0.01 ) . Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving <int> calcium plus vitamin D supplementation </int> had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for <out> hip fracture </out> ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.72 to 1.08 ) , 0.90 for <out> clinical spine fracture </out> ( 0.74 to 1.10 ) , and 0.96 for <out> total fractures </out> ( 0.91 to 1.02 ) . The <out> risk of renal calculi </out> increased with <int> calcium plus vitamin D </int> ( hazard ratio , 1.17 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 1.02 to 1.34 ) . Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard <out> ratio </out> for <out> hip fracture </out> to 0.71 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.52 to 0.97 ) . Effects did not vary significantly according to prer and omization serum vitamin D levels . CONCLUSIONS Among <pop> healthy postmenopausal women </pop> , <int> calcium with vitamin D supplementation </int> result ed in a small but significant improvement in <out> hip bone density </out> , did not significantly reduce <out> hip fracture </out> , and increased the <out> risk of kidney stones . </out> ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00000611 . )",

METHODS We r and omly assigned <pop> 1637 postmenopausal women with prior vertebral fractures to receive 20 or 40 <int> microg of parathyroid hormone ( </pop> 1 - <pop> 34 ) </pop> or <pop> placebo </int> </pop> , administered subcutaneously by the <pop> women daily . </pop> We obtained vertebral radiographs at base line and at the end of the study ( median duration of observation , 21 months ) and performed serial measurements of bone mass by dual-energy <int> x-ray absorptiometry </int> . RESULTS <out> New vertebral fractures </out> occurred in 14 percent of the women in the <int> placebo </int> group and in 5 percent and 4 percent , respectively , of the women in the 20-microg and 40-microg parathyroid hormone groups ; the respective relative risks of <out> fracture </out> in the 20-microg and 40-microg groups , as compared with the placebo group , were 0.35 and 0.31 ( 95 percent confidence intervals , 0.22 to 0.55 and 0.19 to 0.50 ) . New <out> nonvertebral fragility fractures </out> occurred in 6 percent of the women in the placebo group and in 3 percent of those in each parathyroid hormone group ( relative risk , 0.47 and 0.46 , respectively [ 95 percent confidence intervals , 0.25 to 0.88 and 0.25 to 0.861 ) . As compared with <int> placebo </int> , the 20-microg and 40-microg doses of <int> parathyroid </int> hormone increased <out> bone mineral density </out> by 9 and 13 more percentage points in the lumbar spine and by 3 and 6 more percentage points in the femoral neck ; the 40-microg dose decreased <out> bone mineral density at the shaft of the radius </out> by 2 more percentage points . Both doses increased <out> total-body bone mineral </out> by 2 to 4 more percentage points than did <int> placebo . </int> Parathyroid hormone had only <out> minor side effects ( occasional nausea and headache ) . </out> CONCLUSIONS Treatment of <pop> postmenopausal osteoporosis </pop> with <int> parathyroid hormone ( 1 - 34 ) </int> decreases the risk of <out> vertebral and nonvertebral fractures ; </out> increases <out> vertebral , femoral , and total-body bone mineral density ; </out> and is well <out> tolerated . </out> The 40-microg dose increased <out> bone mineral density </out> more than the 20-microg dose but had similar effects on the <out> risk of fracture </out> and was more likely to have side effects",

A total of 241 osteoporotic patients were enrolled </pop> in a 24-month r and omized open label study . The control group ( without treatment ; n = 121 ) and the <int> vitamin K2-treated </int> group ( n = 120 ) , which received <int> 45 </int> mg/day <int> orally vitamin K2 </int> , were followed for <out> lumbar bone mineral density ( LBMD ; </out> measured by <int> dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </int> [ DXA ] ) and occurrence of new <out> clinical fractures . Serum level of Glu-osteocalcin ( Glu-OC ) and menaquinone-4 levels </out> were measured at the end of the follow-up period . <out> Serum level of OC and urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline ( DPD ) </out> were measured before and after the treatment . The background data of these two groups were identical . The incidence of <out> clinical fractures </out> during the 2 years of treatment in the control was higher than the <int> vitamin K2-treated </int> group ( chi2 = 10.935 ; p = 0.0273 ) . The percentages of change from the initial value of <out> LBMD </out> at 6 , 12 , and 24 months after the initiation of the study were -1.8 + /- 0.6 % , -2.4 + /- 0.7 % , and -3.3 + /- 0.8 % for the control group , and 1.4 + /- 0.7 % , -0.1 + /- 0.6 % , and -0.5 + /- 1.0 % for the vitamin K2-treated group , respectively . The <out> changes in LBMD </out> at each time point were significantly different between the control and the treated group ( p = 0.0010 for 6 months , p = 0.0153 for 12 months , and p = 0.0339 for 24 months ) . The <out> serum levels of Glu-OC </out> at the end of the observation period in the control and the treated group were 3.0 + /- 0.3 ng/ml and 1.6 + /- 0.1 ng/ml , respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) , while the <out> serum level of OC </out> measured by the conventional radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) showed a significant rise ( 42.4 + /-6.9 % from the basal value ) in the treated group at 24 months ( 18.2 + /- 6.1 % for the controls;p = 0.0081 ) . There was no significant change in <out> urinary DPD </out> excretion in the treated group . These findings suggest that <int> vitamin K2 </int> treatment effectively prevents the occurrence of <out> new fractures </out> , although the <int> vitamin K2-treated </int> group failed to increase in <out> LBMD . </out> Furthermore , <int> vitamin K2 </int> treatment enhances <out> gamma-carboxylation </out> of the OC molecule",

We aim ed to assess whether <int> vitamin D3 and calcium </int> , either alone or in combination , were effective in prevention of <out> secondary fractures . </out> METHODS In a factorial- design trial , <pop> 5292 people aged 70 years or older ( 4481 [ 85 % ] of whom were women ) who were mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were r and omly assigned </pop> 800 IU <int> daily oral vitamin D3 , 1000 mg calcium , oral vitamin D3 ( 800 IU per day ) combined with calcium </int> ( <int> 1000 </int> mg <int> per day ) </int> , <int> or placebo . </int> <pop> Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals </pop> were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months . Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was <out> new low-energy fractures . </out> FINDINGS 698 ( 13 % ) of 5292 participants had a new <out> low-trauma fracture </out> , 183 ( 26 % ) of which were of the hip . The incidence of <out> new , low-trauma fractures </out> did not differ significantly between participants allocated <int> calcium </int> and those who were not ( 331 [ 12.6 % ] of 2617 vs 367 [ 13.7 % ] of 2675 ; hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.94 [ 95 % CI 0.81 - 1.09 ] ) ; between participants allocated <int> vitamin D3 </int> and those who were not ( 353 [ 13.3 % ] of 2649 vs 345 [ 13.1 % ] of 2643 ; 1.02 [ 0.88 - 1.19 ] ) ; or between those allocated <int> combination treatment </int> and those assigned <int> placebo </int> ( 165 [ 12.6 % ] of 1306 vs 179 [ 13.4 % ] of 1332 ; HR for interaction term 1.01 [ 0.75 - 1.36 ] ) . The groups did not differ in the <out> incidence </out> of <out> all-new fractures , fractures confirmed by radiography , hip fractures , death , number of falls , or quality of life . </out> By 24 months , 2886 ( 54.5 % ) of 5292 were still taking <out> tablets </out> , 451 ( 8.5 % ) had <out> died </out> , 58 ( 1.1 % ) had <out> withdrawn </out> , and 1897 ( 35.8 % ) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes . <out> Compliance with tablets containing calcium </out> was <out> significantly lower </out> ( difference : 9.4 % [ 95 % CI 6.6 - 12.2 ] ) , partly because of <out> gastrointestinal symptoms . </out> However , potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between groups .

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of <int> etidronate and menatetrenone </int> on <out> bone mineral density ( BMD ) and the incidence of vertebral fractures </out> in <pop> postmenopausal women with osteoporosis . Seventy-two osteoporotic women , more than 5 years after menopause , 53\u201378 years of age </pop> , were r and omly divided into three administration groups : E group <int> ; intermittent cyclical etidronate </int> ( 200 mg/day , 14 days per 3 months ; n = 25 ) ; M group <int> ; menatetrenone </int> ( 45 mg/day , daily ; n = 23 ) ; and <int> C group </int> ( <int> control ) ; calcium lactate </int> ( 2 g/day , daily ; n = 24 ) <out> . Forearm BMD </out> was measured by <int> dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </int> at 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 months after the treatment started . There were no significant differences in age , body mass index , years since menopause , and initial BMD among the three groups . One-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with repeated measurements showed a significant <out> decrease in BMD </out> in the C group ( P < 0.0001 ) . Two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements showed a significant <out> increase in BMD </out> in the M group compared with that in the C group ( P < 0.0001 ) , and a significant <out> increase in BMD </out> in the E group compared with that in the C and M groups ( P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01 , respectively ) . <out> The indices of new vertebral fractures/1000 </out> patient-years in the E and M groups were significantly higher than that in the C group ( \u03c72 = 47.7 ; P < 0.0001 and \u03c72 = 42.4 ; P < 0.0001 , respectively ) , and did not differ significantly between the E and M groups . The present preliminary study provides evidence to suggest that , despite the lower increase <out> in BMD </out> produced by <int> me-natetrenone </int> , this agent , as well as etidronate , may have the potential to reduce osteoporotic vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis",

RESULTS Women in the lowest quartile of <int> vitamin K </int> intake ( macro x : 70.2 microg/d ) had significantly ( P < or = 0.005 ) lower <out> mean ( + /- SEM ) BMD at the femoral neck </out> ( 0.854 + /- 0.006 g/cm(2 ) ) and <out> spine </out> ( 1.140 + /- 0.010 g/cm(2 ) ) than did those in the highest quartile of <int> vitamin K </int> intake ( macro x : 309 microg/d ) : 0.888 + /- 0.006 and 1.190 + /- 0.010 g/cm(2 ) , respectively . These associations remained after potential confounders were controlled for and after stratification by age or supplement use . No significant association was found between <out> dietary <int> vitamin K </int> intake </out> and <out> BMD </out> in <pop> men . </pop> CONCLUSIONS Low dietary <int> vitamin K </int> intake was associated with <out> low <pop> BMD </out> in women </pop> , consistent with previous reports that low dietary <int> vitamin K </int> intake is associated with an increased risk of <out> hip fracture . </out> In contrast , there was no association between <out> dietary <int> vitamin K </int> intake </out> and <out> BMD </out> in men",

OBJECTIVE The objective was to determine the associations between <int> vitamin K intake </int> <out> , apo E genotype , BMD , and hip fracture </out> in a <pop> population -based cohort of elderly men and women . </pop> DESIGN <int> Dietary vitamin K intake was assessed </int> with <int> a food-frequency question naire </int> in <pop> 335 men and 553 women ( average age : 75.2 y ) participating in the Framingham Heart Study in 1988 - 1989 . </pop> Incidence of hip fractures was recorded from 1988 to 1995 . <out> BMD at the hip , spine , and arm </out> was assessed on 2 separate occasions ( 1988 - 1989 and 1992 - 1993 ) . Comparisons between <out> apo E genotype and BMD </out> were made relative to E4 allele status ( at least 1 epsilon4 allele compared with no epsilon4 allele ) . RESULTS Individuals in the highest quartile of <int> vitamin K </int> intake ( median : 254 microg/d ) had a significantly lower fully adjusted relative risk ( 0.35 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 13 , 0.94 ) of <out> hip fracture </out> than did those in the lowest quartile of intake ( median : 56 microg/d ) . There were no associations between <int> <out> vitamin K </int> intake and BMD </out> in either men or women . No association was found between the <out> E4 allele and BMD </out> , and there were no significant interactions between the E4 <out> allele and phylloquinone intake and BMD or hip fracture . </out> CONCLUSIONS Low <int> vitamin K </int> intakes were associated with an increased incidence of <out> hip fractures </out> in this <pop> cohort of elderly men and women . </pop> Neither low <int> vitamin K </int> intake nor E4 allele status was associated with low BMD",

DESIGN An observational study in which we <pop> assessed the method ological quality of 250 controlled trials from 33 meta-analyses </pop> and then analyzed , using multiple logistic regression models , the associations between those assessment s and estimated treatment effects . DATA SOURCES Meta-analyses from the Cochrane Pregnancy <pop> and Childbirth </pop> Data base . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The associations between <out> estimates of treatment effects </out> and inadequate allocation concealment , exclusions after r and omization , and lack of double-blinding . RESULTS Compared with trials in which authors reported adequately concealed treatment allocation , trials in which concealment was either inadequate or unclear ( did not report or incompletely reported a concealment approach ) yielded larger <out> estimates of treatment effects </out> ( P < .001 ) . <out> Odds ratios </out> were exaggerated by 41 % for inadequately concealed trials and by 30 % for unclearly concealed trials ( adjusted for other aspects of quality ) . Trials in which participants had been excluded after r and omization did not yield larger estimates of effects , but that lack of association may be due to incomplete reporting . Trials that were not double-blind also yielded larger <out> estimates of effects </out> ( P = .01 ) , with <out> odds ratios </out> being exaggerated by 17 % . CONCLUSIONS This study provides empirical evidence that inadequate method ological approaches in controlled trials , particularly those representing poor allocation concealment , are associated with bias . Readers of trial reports should be wary of these pitfalls , and investigators must improve their design , execution , and reporting of trials",

            "abstract": "Meta- analysis of binary data involves the computation of a weighted average of summary statistics calculated for each trial . The selection of the appropriate summary statistic is a subject of debate due to conflicts in the relative importance of mathematical properties and the ability to intuitively interpret results . This paper explores the process of identifying a summary statistic most likely to be consistent across trials when there is variation in control group event rates . Four summary statistics are considered : <out> odds ratios ( OR ) ; risk differences ( RD ) and risk ratios of beneficial ( RR(B ) ) ; and harmful outcomes ( RR(H ) ) </out> . Each summary statistic corresponds to a different pattern of predicted absolute benefit of treatment with variation in baseline risk , the greatest difference in patterns of prediction being between RR(B ) and RR(H ) . Selection of a summary statistic solely based on identification of the best-fitting model by comparing tests of heterogeneity is problematic , principally due to low numbers of trials . It is proposed that choice of a summary statistic should be guided by both empirical evidence and clinical ly informed debate as to which model is likely to be closest to the expected pattern of treatment benefit across baseline risks . Empirical investigations comparing the <pop> four summary statistics on a sample of 551 systematic review s </pop> provide evidence that the <out> RR and OR models </out> are on average <out> more consistent </out> than <out> RD </out> , there being no difference on average between <out> RR </out> and <out> OR . </out> From a <pop> second sample of 114 meta-analyses </pop> evidence indicates that for interventions aim ed at preventing an undesirable event , greatest <out> absolute benefits </out> are observed in trials with the highest baseline event rates , corresponding to the model of constant RR(H ) . The appropriate selection for a particular meta- analysis may depend on underst and ing reasons for variation in control group event rates ; in some situations uncertainty about the choice of summary statistic will remain",

However , the conclusions are less clear when the included studies have differing results . In an attempt to establish whether studies are consistent , reports of meta-analyses commonly present a statistical test of heterogeneity . The test seeks to determine whether there are genuine differences underlying the results of the studies ( heterogeneity ) , or whether the variation in findings is compatible with chance alone ( homogeneity ) . However , the test is susceptible to the number of trials included in the meta- analysis . We have developed a new quantity , I 2 , which we believe gives a better measure of the consistency between trials in a meta- analysis . Assessment of the <out> consistency of effects </out> across studies is an essential part of meta- analysis . Unless we know how consistent the results of studies are , we can not determine the generalisability of the findings of the meta- analysis . Indeed , several hierarchical systems for grading evidence state that the results of studies must be consistent or homogeneous to obtain the highest grading.2\u20134 <out> Tests for heterogeneity </out> are commonly used to decide on methods for combining studies and for concluding <out> consistency </out> or <out> inconsistency </out> of findings .5 6 But what does the test achieve in practice , and how should the result ing P values be interpreted ? A test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect . The usual test statistic",

METHODS : The <pop> QUOROM group consisted </pop> of <pop> 30 clinical epidemiologists , clinicians , statisticians , editors , and research ers . </pop> In conference , the group was asked to identify items they thought should be included in a <int> checklist of st and ards . </int> Whenever possible , checklist items were guided by research evidence suggesting that failure to adhere to the item proposed could lead to biased results . A modified Delphi technique was used in assessing c and i date items . FINDINGS : The conference result ed in the QUOROM statement , a checklist , and a flow diagram . The checklist describes our preferred way to present the <out> abstract </out> , <out> introduction , methods , </out> results , and discussion sections of a report of a meta- analysis . It is organised into 21 headings and subheadings regarding search es , selection , validity assessment , data abstract ion , study characteristics , and quantitative data synthesis , and in the results with < < trial flow > > , study characteristics , and quantitative data synthesis ; research documentation was identified for eight of the 18 items . The flow diagram provides information about both the numbers of RCTs identified , included , and excluded and the reasons for exclusion of trials . INTERPRETATION : We hope this report will generate further thought about ways to improve the <out> quality of reports </out> of meta-analyses of RCTs and that interested readers , review ers , research ers , and editors will use the QUOROM statement and generate ideas for its improvement .

We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials , and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses . Design : Medline search to identify <pop> pairs consisting of a meta- analysis and a single large trial ( </pop> concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30 % of the trial ) <pop> ; analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a h and search of four leading general medicine journals 1993 - 6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s. </pop> Main outcome measure : <out> Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept </out> from regression of st and ard normal deviates against precision . Results : In the <pop> eight pairs of meta- analysis and large trial that were identified ( five from cardiovascular medicine , one from diabetic medicine , one from geriatric medicine , one from perinatal medicine ) </pop> there were four concordant and four discordant pairs . In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects . <out> Funnel plot asymmetry </out> was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs . In 14 ( 38 % ) journal meta-analyses and 5 ( 13 % ) Cochrane review s , <out> funnel plot asymmetry </out> indicated that there was bias . Conclusions : A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses , but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution . Key messages Systematic review s of r and omised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence ; however , the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials Funnel plots , plots of the trials ' effect estimates against sample size , are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases Funnel plot asymmetry , measured by regression analysis , predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials Funnel <out> plot asymmetry </out> was found in 38 % of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13 % of review s from the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s Critical examination of systematic review s for publication and related biases should be considered a routine",

            "abstract": "Discrepancies may occur between the results of <pop> large r and omized trials </pop> and the pooled results of several <pop> small </pop> trials in <pop> meta-analyses </pop> ( 14 ) . Previous studies have suggested that discrepancies may be due to publication bias , that is , the fact that small trials are more likely to be published if they show a statistically significant intervention effect ( 58 ) . Previous empirical studies of the association between method ologic <out> quality </out> and <out> intervention </out> effects have had inconsistent conclusions ( 912 ) . In theory , adequate r and <pop> omization </pop> requires adequate generation of the allocation sequence and adequate allocation concealment . The assumption is partly supported by studies from Schulz and colleagues ( 10 ) and Moher and associates ( 11 , 12 ) , who found that trials with inadequate allocation concealment exaggerate <out> intervention effects </out> significantly compared with trials reporting adequate allocation concealment . However , Emerson and coworkers ( 9 ) found no association between reported <out> allocation concealment and intervention effects . </out> Furthermore , none of the studies ( 912 ) found a significant association between <out> generation of allocation sequence and intervention effects </out> , although Schulz and colleagues found a nonsignificant trend ( 10 ) . Schulz and colleagues ( 10 ) , who analyzed <pop> trials in pregnancy and childbirth </pop> , found that trials without double blinding exaggerate <out> intervention effects </out> significantly compared with double-blind trials . However , Emerson and coworkers ( 9 ) and Moher and associates ( 11 ) , who <pop> included trials from several therapeutic areas </pop> , found no association between <out> double blinding </out> and intervention <out> effects . </out> Method ologic quality can be assessed by using separate components , as in the studies discussed above , or by using one of several quality scales ( 13 ) . One popular scale , developed by Jadad and colleagues in 1996 ( 14 ) , has thus far received 233 registered citations ( Institute for Scientific Information , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ) . The scale includes assessment of the reported <out> generation of allocation sequence , double blinding , </out> and <out> follow-up . </out> Moher and associates ( 11 , 12 ) found that trials with a low score on this scale <out> exaggerate intervention effects </out> significantly compared with trials that have high quality scores . However , the use of this and other quality scales has been disputed by Jni and coworkers ( 15 ) , who showed that several quality scales produce inconsistent conclusions . We studied the potential association between reported method ologic quality and intervention effects to assess whether method ologic quality may explain discrepancies between the results of <pop> large and small r and omized trials in meta-analyses . </pop> Methods Identification and Selection of Meta-Analyses and Trials According to suggestions in other studies ( 24 ) , we arbitrarily defined <pop> trials with 1000 or more participants as large . </pop> We search ed the Cochrane Library , MEDLINE on PubMed ( using meta- analysis , review , r and omi*ed , and controlled clinical trial as free text search words ) , and reference lists of relevant articles to identify potentially eligible meta-analyses that included at least one large trial . We identified <pop> 23 eligible meta-analyses . Nine were excluded </pop> because they included <pop> trials </pop> that <pop> were also included </pop> in <pop> larger eligible meta-analyses ( n = 5 ) </pop> , lacked references to the primary trials ( n = 3 ) , or excluded low- quality trials ( n = 1 ) . Accordingly , <pop> 14 meta-analyses ( 1626 ) </pop> were included . Three of the included Cochrane Review s included two meta-analyses each ( 22 , 25 , 26 ) . <pop> The meta-analyses included 248 trials , of which 58 were excluded because they were unpublished ( n = 33 ) , were quasi-r and omized ( n = 15 ) , or were published as abstract s ( n = 8) . </pop> We were unable to translate 2 Spanish- language articles . <pop> The remaining 190 trials , published as English- language ( n = 188 ) or German- language ( n = 2 ) full-length articles , were included . </pop> Our <pop> analyses </pop> included <pop> 23 large and 167 small r and omized trials and a total of 136 164 participants . </pop> On the basis of the study by Schulz and colleagues ( 10 ) , who analyzed <pop> 250 controlled trials with 62 091 participants </pop> , we estimated that our sample size would be large enough to show significant differences between intervention benefits in high- quality and low- quality trials . Assessment of <out> Method ologic Quality Method ologic quality </out> was defined as the confidence that the trial 's design , conduct , analysis , and presentation minimized or avoided biases in the trial 's intervention comparisons ( 12 ) . The reported method ologic quality was assessed in an unmasked manner by using four separate components and a composite quality scale . The four components were generation of the allocation sequence ( adequate [ computer-generated r and om numbers or similar ] or inadequate [ not described ] ) , allocation concealment ( adequate [ central independent unit , sealed envelopes , or similar ] or inadequate [ not described or open table of r and om numbers or similar ] ) , double blinding ( adequate [ identical placebo tablets or similar ] or inadequate [ not performed or tablets versus injections or similar ] ) , and follow-up ( adequate [ number and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals described ] or inadequate [ number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals not described ] ) . The five-point quality scale included generation of the allocation sequence ( 2 points , computer-generated r and om numbers or similar ; 1 point , not described ; 0 points , quasi-r and omized trial [ which we excluded ] ) , double blinding ( 2 points , identical placebo tablets or similar ; 1 point , not described ; 0 points , no blinding or inadequate method , such as tablets versus injections or similar ) , and follow-up ( 1 point , number and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals described ; 0 points , number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals not described ) . The <out> quality score </out> was ranked as low ( 2 points ) or high ( 3 points ) , as suggested elsewhere ( 11 ) . Two review ers assessed the effect of masking and the interobserver reliability of the quality assessment s. The reported method <pop> ologic quality of 30 trials </pop> was assessed with and without masking the names of the authors and journal , the year of publication , acknowledgments , institutional affiliations , and funding . The <int> unmasked assessment s </int> were performed first . The <int> masked assessment </int> s were performed 3 months later , ensuring that the assessors did not remember the trials . The difference between masked and unmasked quality assessment s was not significant ( mean [ SE <out> ] quality score </out> , 3.70 0.19 vs. 3.63 0.21 ; P > 0.2 ) . <out> Interobserver reliability </out> was assessed by using <pop> 30 r and </pop> omized <pop> trials </pop> r and omly selected from the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and was found to be high ( intraclass correlation coefficient , 0.96 [ 95 % CI , 0.92 to 0.98 ] ) ( 27 ) . After assessing the quality of 100 <pop> trials </pop> , we reassessed the method ologic quality of the trials from the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and found that the <out> testretest reliability </out> was high ( 0.98 [ CI , 0.97 to 0.99 ] ) ( 27 ) . Data Extraction Data were extracted independently by two review ers . First , the primary <out> binary outcome measure </out> described by the largest number of trials in each meta- analysis was identified . We then extracted the <out> number </out> of events in the intervention and control groups and the number of participants r and omly assigned to the intervention and control groups . All disagreements were due to inaccurate data extraction and were resolved through further consulting of the original articles and meta-analyses . Consensus was achieved before analyses were done in all cases . Statistical Analysis Analyses were performed by using SAS for Windows , version 6.12 ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , North Carolina ) or SPSS for Windows , version 10.0 ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , Illinois ) . Differences between the masked and unmasked quality assessment s were estimated by using the KruskalWallis test . The <out> number </out> of <pop> participants </pop> and the <out> year </out> <pop> of publication in trials with adequate versus inadequate generation of allocation sequence , allocation concealment , double blinding </pop> , <pop> and follow-up </pop> and <pop> high </pop> versus <pop> low quality scores </pop> were compared by using the Pearson chi-square test . To estimate evidence of publication bias and other biases , we used linear regression to analyze funnel-plot asymmetry ( 7 ) . The st and ard normal deviate , defined as the log odds ratio divided by its st and ard error , was regressed against the precision ( the inverse of the st and ard error ) . If funnel-plot asymmetry is present , the regression line will not run through the origin , and the intercept will provide a measure of asymmetry . Intervention effects were estimated by using the <out> number of </out> events and participants in the treatment group and the number of events and participants in the control group ( Appendix ) . Accordingly , two observations were needed per trial , one for the intervention group and one for the control group . When necessary , positive outcomes were re-expressed as unwanted end points , for example , <out> mortality instead of survival . </out> Discrepancies between intervention effects in large and small trials were estimated by the <out> ratio of odds ratios ( 10 ) </out> , which is the summary odds ratio of large trials divided by the summary odds ratio of small trials . In this modeling convention , a ratio of odds ratios less than 1.0 indicates that a group of trials ( for example , small trials with inadequate allocation concealment ) exaggerates the intervention effect compared with the referent group ( for example , large trials ) . Variance and confidence intervals were increased to adjust for overdispersion ( Appendix ) . The Pearson chi-square test was used to estimate the potential overlap between quality components . Results Characteristics of Included Trials We were able to locate and retrieve <pop> all 190 included trials </pop> and to reproduce the results reported in the <pop> meta-analyses ( 1626 ) </pop> ( Table 1 ) . Of the <pop> 190 trials </pop> , 81 ( 43 % ) reported adequate generation of the allocation sequence , 68 ( 36 % ) reported adequate allocation concealment , 103 ( 54 % ) reported adequate double blinding , and",
